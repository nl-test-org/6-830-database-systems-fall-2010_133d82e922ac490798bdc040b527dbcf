We will continue discussing database system internals, based on the same paper of last lecture:

Hellerstein, Joseph, Michael Stonebraker, and James Hamilton. "Architecture of a Database System." _Foundations and Trends in Databases_ 1, no. 2 (2007): 141-259. (![This resource may not render correctly in a screen reader.](/images/inacessible.gif)[PDF](http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/fntdb07-architecture.pdf))

We will be focusing on query processing, optimization and memory/storage management. This is still an overview of the concepts that we will present in more details in following lectures.
