This lecture will cover buffer and memory management strategies in database systems.

Read the following paper:

Chou, Hong-Tai, and David DeWitt. _An Evaluation of Buffer Management Strategies for Relational Database Systems_. Proceedings of VLDB, 1985, pp. 127-141.

As you read, think about and come to class prepared to answer the following questions:

*   How much better is the hot-set model than simple LRU?
*   Under what circumstances is LRU a bad idea?
*   Why can these techniques be applied in database systems but not operating systems?
