Yu, Yuan, et al. "DryadLINQ: A System for General-Purpose Distributed Data-Parallel Computing Using a High-Level Language." OSDI, 2008. (![This resource may not render correctly in a screen reader.](/images/inacessible.gif)[PDF](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/dryadlinq/dryadlinq.pdf))

DryadLINQ is a programming language for manipulating structured data in a distributed setting. It provides a collection of SQL-like constructs that are well-integrated into C# (with a common type and object system), and compiles down to a graph of operators spread across a distributed network of machines in a way similar to how distributed databases work.

As you read the paper, consider the following questions:

1.  What are the advantages of a query language that is integrated into the programming language? Are there disadvantages?
2.  Dryad execution plans look a lot like database query plans, but are different in some ways â€” in particular, operators can have multiple outputs; what are the implications of this from a query execution perspective?
